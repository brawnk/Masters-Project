# Masters-Project

Physics final year masters project from 2017/2018 - using CNN networks with simulated data for Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) far detector that is currently under construction in the USA. Conventional methods use boosted decision trees but requires pre-processing to human-conceived variables in order to be used, limited potential performance. Instead we can generate images of the event using all available data and allow CNN to learn patterns to identify event types, and individual particles in events.

Example of CNN used shown alongside code used to generate images from generated event csv data.
